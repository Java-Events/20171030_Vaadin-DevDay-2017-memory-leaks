# 20171030_Vaadin-DevDay-2017-memory-leaks
Vaadin Dev Days 2017 - New York and Montreal

In this session I will show a few things that will lead to Memory Leaks
and how to avoid them. For this we are using 
a few small demo Vaadin Apps and some tooling.

## Demo App 01
Here we will see that an App will consume 
a lot of memory. The consumption is produced by bigger 
memory blocks. To do this we are working with images.
